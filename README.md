Source code for SneakerFinder micro-site tool (http://ergodatainsights.tech/) which aids in discovering sneakers.  Developed during the first three weeks of the Spring 2020 Insights Data Science fellowship in San Francisco (2020A.SV)

Employs CNN transfer learning to find sneakers which are similar a picture of a pair you like!

Full database from UT available here: http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/finegrained/utzap50k/

Future iterations to include:
  - transfer learning representation
  - beta-VAE representation
  - design aid tool to automatically generate initial designs based on a "brief" of text input and exaple pictures in order to increase the speed and efficacy of the design process.
